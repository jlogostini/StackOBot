# StackOBot
Stack’O’Bot is a small project that can be a good starting point for advanced beginners.

It uses all of the new features found in Unreal Engine 5 Early Access in a playful and approachable way. From the latest and greatest like Nanite and Lumen to the quality-of-life changes and improvements like Packed Level Blueprints and Enhanced Input, this vertical slice has everything you need to get started making your own game in Unreal Engine 5.

The player controller shows a simple but powerful setup, including lean, landing, physic setup, and slope warp leveraging FBIK. As a unique feature you can “print” a new robot and jump on the robots heads you left in the level.

It contains an expandable interaction system and several gameplay modules ready to be used in a level. Even with no programming background, you can build some puzzles and levels with it.

Paired with our introductory presentation that gives you an overview of each facet of the project, this demo has everything a new developer needs to get started, while also providing a handy toolbox for more experienced indies to sink their teeth into.
